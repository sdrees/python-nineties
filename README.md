# python-nineties
Ease the reading of relics from the Nineties

## What is in it
A small, maybe growing collection of parsers and filters
to ease dealing with specific information structures that
drop off of REST backends ;-)

## What is not yet in it
just sayin':
* proxy tools like digitally signed high water mark
* storage via lzma compression
* work log analysis
* process mining support
* flattening of deeply nested records
* refactoring the elderly pypi / packaging boilerplate
* explore github actions vs. travis et al.
* make user defined fields accessible per configuration
* provide time tracking views from work log entries

Note: The name of the default branch is `default` :wink:
